# 307 SBA | Hallan Batman | HTML & CSS
This is my @PerScholas Skill Based Assessement for lecture 307 HTML & CSS. Potentially a Capstone Project as well. I call it eToolBox

The goal of this project is to help small bike shops and side-hustlers like myself manage their operations with online admin tasks, such as keeping track of customers information, inventory of parts, service repairs time estimate and documentation, as well as having a handy pricelist readly available - all in one place, like a tool box, but online.

## Pages
- 'Home'
- Customers
